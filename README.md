# KPMG Virtual Internship

These tasks are part of the KPMG virtual internship in Data Science / Analytics.


**Task 1** was to assess a client's submission of three data sets regarding data quality (completeness, validity, etc.).
Finally, a feedback mail for the client was to be written, detailing issues with the data and how these would impact the analyses.


**Task 2** was to make a presentation detailing the analysis plan for the data we received above, the goal being to predict which new client is likely to yield the highest profit.


**Task 3** was to make a Tableu dashboard to illustrate the findings, see below.
