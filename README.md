# KPMG Virtual Internship

These tasks are part of the KPMG virtual internship in Data Science / Analytics.


Task 1 was to assess a client's submission of three data sets regarding data quality (completeness, validity, etc.).
Finally, a feedback mail for the client was to be written, detailing issues with the data and how these would impact the analyses.
